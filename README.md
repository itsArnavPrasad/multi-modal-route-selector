# multi-modal-route-selector
Built during the LogiTHON 2025 hackathon our project aims to help small logistics providers quickly determine the best shipping routes across borders. By analyzing shipment details, it recommends optimal routing based on cost estimates, transit times, and feasibility for different transportation modes (air, sea, land, or combinations).
